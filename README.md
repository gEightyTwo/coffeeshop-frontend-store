# CoffeeShop (Store)

CoffeeShop is a mobile coffee ordering web application.  It allows users to create a profile, log in, and order custom coffee drinks. Users can craft drink orders and set the time they want to pick up their drinks for a delay up to 30 minutes.  Coffee shop owners can then receive incoming orders on the shop_facing side of this application, sorted by pickup time, and fulfill orders.

The app utilizes the Google API location codes to find the nearest coffee shops and walking distance to the shop.* (coming soon!)
